# Design-patterns

# 1. Factory Design Pattern (FactoryDesignPatters.java)
	 In Factory pattern, we create object without exposing the creation logic 
	 to the client and refer to newly created object using a common interface.
	
# 2. Abstract Factory Design Pattern (AbstractFactoryExample.java)
	 In Abstract Factory pattern an interface is responsible for creating a
	 factory of related objects without explicitly specifying their classes. Each
	 generated factory can give the objects as per the Factory pattern	 
	 
# 3. Builder Design Pattern (BuilderPatternExample.java)
	 Builder pattern builds a complex object using simple objects and using a step
	 by step approach. This type of design pattern comes under creational pattern
	 as this pattern provides one of the best ways to create an object.	 
	 
# 4. Adapter Design Pattern (AdapterDesignPatternExample.java)
		Adapter pattern works as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces. This
		type of design pattern comes under structural pattern as this pattern
		combines the capability of two independent interfaces	 
		
# 5. Filter Design Pattern (FilterPatternExample.java)
		Filter pattern or Criteria pattern is a design pattern that enables
		developers to filter a set of objects using different criteria and chaining
		them in a decoupled way through logical operations. This type of design
		pattern comes under structural pattern as this pattern combines multiple
		criteria to obtain single criteria.	
		
# 6. Facade Design Pattern (FacadePatternExample.java)
		Facade pattern hides the complexities of the system and provides an interface
		to the client using which the client can access the system. This type of
		design pattern comes under structural pattern as this pattern adds an
		interface to existing system to hide its complexities
